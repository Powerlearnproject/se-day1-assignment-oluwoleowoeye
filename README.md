# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the development and programming of software, writing codes, testing and deploying. 
It is important in effective automative tasks.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Artifical intelligence
2. Prompt engineering


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements
Writing codes
Testing codes
Deploying codes

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodologies involves software development that cannnot be easily changed and controlled 
Agile methodologies can be easily changed, modfified and controlled

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer develops code
A quality assurance tests code
A project manager manages the projects in software development

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE are visual studio code that can be used to write and test codes before deloyment
Version control systems is for example github that manages code changes

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges are requirements and modification

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing is a single testing of part of a code
integration testing involves different codes
system testing is a complete code
acceptance testing is user testing to meet requirement

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of asking AI the right questions to have the right answer

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
what is cat is a vague
what is a cat as an animal -concise
what is a cat in linux - concise
